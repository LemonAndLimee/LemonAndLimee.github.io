High Level and Low Level Languages

<div class="header">High Level Languages</div>
</br></br>
<span class="point"><span class="highlight2">A high level programming language</span> uses code written in a way that is 
<span class="highlight1">similar to a natural human language</span>, such as English.</span>
</br></br>
<span class="point"><span class="highlight1">Programmers prefer to use high level programming languages</span> as they are <span class="highlight1">easier to understand, learn and program.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">High level programming languages also <span class="highlight1">allow the use of powerful commands that perform quite complex tasks.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">High level languages are <span class="highlight1">used when the execution speed is not critical.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">A high-level language <span class="highlight1">must be translated into a low-level language before 
it can be run</span>, as they <span class="highlight1">cannot be executed directly by the CPU.</span></span>

</br></br></br></br></br></br>


<div class="header">Low Level Languages</div>
</br></br>
<span class="point"><span class="highlight2">Assembly language</span> is a <span class="highlight2">low level language</span> consisting of 
<span class="highlight1">abbreviations and symbols</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">It is <span class="highlight1">more simple than high level languages</span>
, but <span class="highlight1">easier to understand than pure machine code.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">It is <span class="highlight1">converted to machine code</span> using an <span class="highlight2">assembler.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">Low level languages have a <span class="highlight1">faster execution speed</span> than high level languages.</span>

</br></br></br></br></br></br>


<div class="header">Machine Code</div>
</br></br>
<span class="point"><span class="highlight2">Machine language</span> is made up entirely of <span class="highlight1">binary or hexadecimal instructions.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">It is <span class="highlight1">rarely typed directly into the computer</span>
 as it is <span class="highlight1">very long</span>, and is <span class="highlight1">susceptible to typing errors.</span></span>
</br></br>
<span class="point">It is most often <span class="highlight1">translated to from high level languages.</span></span>
